Results for limma analysis
==========================

Three folders containing analysis repeated at the 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 significance level

In each folder:

Between Groups
--------------
	
Between groups is where adult and senescent are both compared with neonatal cell lines. 
All possible combinations of this are performed (i.e. cell line G with A, B and C). 
These were conducted independently and then the percentage of times gene g was less than the desired significance 
level was calculated and plotted in the bar graphs. Both the control and treated time series were compared for 
both the adult and senescent cell lines. 


Within Groups
-------------
Within groups is comparison between cell lines within each neonatal, senescent or adult groups (three per group - for example [(A, B), (A, C), (B, C)].
Again the data are aggregated by percentage less than the significance level and displayed as bar plots. 
Under the `within groups' heading there are the two treatments, TGFb and Control for a total of 6 graphs.
