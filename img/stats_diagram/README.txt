We are primarily interest in three questions:
   q1) Does gene g respond to TGFb? - Compare TGFb vs Control groups
   
   This has been done in the R script but I have not plotted because I want to focus the paper figures on differences between N/A/S cell lines
   
   q2) Is the gene g response different in adult/senescent compared to neonatal cell lines? - Compare Control groups for cell lines 
   q3) Is the gene g response to TGFb different in adult/senescent compared to neonatal cell lines? - Compare treated groups for cell lines
